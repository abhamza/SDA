// TODO: You have to implement $compareElements$, $getHashValue$ and
//       $getIntersection$ defined in Array.h.
//       - Your implementation of $compareElements$ and $getHashValue$ have to
//         to be specialized to char*.
//       - HOWEVER, your implementation of $getIntersection$ must be generic
//       (and relies on $compareElements$ and $getHashValue$).
